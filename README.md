MineLib.GraphicClient
==============================

Graphic client for MineLib.ClientWrapper

For now, focusing on 2D stuff like menu and GUI. Probably would need some help with 3D part.
Will be cross-platform. Using Monogame. If all will go good, it will work on Windows, Linux and Android. Mac OS X will be added too. Dunno about iOS, don't have it. lol.
